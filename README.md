# ripview
A recreation of the popular transport app built on a Next.Js stack, porting into the Transport NSW apis.

# Current way to start the app and development server:
1.  There is a directory called nextjs-blog which is home to all of our NextJS files. CD into this (run the following command in terminal):
``` cd nextjs-blog ```

2. To start the server, you can run the following command:
```npm run dev```

This starts a server that you can use for development on port 3000, you can access this on:
> http://localhost:3000
